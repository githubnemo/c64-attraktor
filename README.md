# Lorenz Attraktor on C64

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2ddfaac-57ff-45fa-83a3-d15bf8e24276

## Compiling / Development

This project uses the [ACME][acme] assembler for no particular reason
but that it was the least complicated and most easy to find assembler.
I used ACME 0.97.

For testing I found it best to use [VICE][vice], I had a few problems
launching .PRG files with the default configuration so I created my
own launch script which enables auto start PRG mode.

Note: the script assumes that ROM files (KERNAL, BASIC, character set)
are present in the ROM/ directory. Make sure to place them there.
They can be found in the release [download][vice download] of VICE.

## Running

    cd src
    make run

The screen should turn black and green dots should appear.

Note that normally you would need to start the program yourself using
a `SYS 2049` statement (or whatever the initial address is) to jump into
the code. We add a header value that adds a bit of BASIC code that does
this for us.

If you want to run a specific version of VICE, set the `X64SC` environment
variable.

## Running on C64

I used a SD2IEC adapter and copied the `src/myprg.prg` file to the root
of the SD card. Then it is just a matter of loading the program:

    LOAD "myprg.prg",8
    RUN

I had problems where the SD2IEC adapter didn't even load the directory list
(`LOAD "$",8`) and simply flashed the error LED. Do diagnose this I ran this
code:

    10 OPEN 15,8,15: INPUT #15,A$,B$,C$,D$
    20 CLOSE 15
    30 PRINT A$,B$,C$,D$
    RUN

The message I got was "74,Drive not ready,12,0" which was caused by a
intermittent fault of the SD card socket (card detect or write protect was not
triggered correctly). Re-inserting the SD card a few times solved the issue.

## Usage

There are three keys you can press:

- R for clearing the screen and resetting the X/Y/Z values
- N to play a melodic sound based on the current trajectory
- M to play a bass sound based on the current trajectory
- F for toggling [fast multiplication](#Fast-multiplication)

## Fast multiplication

`FMULT` from the BASIC kernal is not the fastest multiplication routine
there could be and by far the worst offender in terms of runtime, at least
according to [VICE profiling](https://vice-emu.sourceforge.io/vice_12.html#SEC336)
which shows that it takes around +55% of the total runtime just to do `FMULT`
and that is after we already used things like shifting the exponent directly
to multiply `dt`:

Ever since I stumbled upon [this writeup](https://probablydance.com/2025/02/08/why-does-integer-addition-approximate-float-multiplication/)
about multiplying floats by adding them I wanted to try this for CBM floats
and, after lots of simulation [in python](./src/mult_exp.py) I finally reached
an implementation that can draw the Lorentz attraktor. The python implementation
to simulate the CBM floats is not 100% accurate as it doesn't simulate the
presence of an always-set MSB in the mantissa for normalization (bit 31).
But since it is always-set in RAM to simulate the mantissa it *should* be
equivalent. At least the algorithm in assembler doesn't diverge much from
the python implementation.

Drawing `f(x) = 2/3 x + 0.5`:
![Drawing `f(x) = 2/3 x + 0.5`](./assets/fast_mul_test1.png)

The original implementation uses a certain bias to correct the mantissa,
on average, for the error. I decided to go with the naÃ¯ve implementation
at a higher error (I think ~10%). If you want, you can implement that, of course.

Now the profile looks like this:

`FMULT` - or rather `fast_mult` - is not even in the top 3 now. We effectively
removed the main bottleneck and are still drawing the equation rather nicely
considering the gain.

System with fast multiplication, errors are visible but OK:

What about the future? So what are the main offenders now?

`$b999` is, according to [this helpful page](https://skoolkid.github.io/sk6502/c64rom/asm/B983.html#B999),
a subroutine for float to integer conversion. `.CONUPK` is used in the fast
mult for convenience to unpack the CBM float from RAM into FAC1. Both
could probably be optimized for the use case but I think the error is
already large enough as to not risk adding more.

There are three python scripts that were helpful in the development of
the final assembler code.

1. [`attraktor.py`](./attraktor.py) - a reference implementation that got
   subsequently optimized to bit oeprations
2. [`encode_xy.py`](./src/encode_xy.py) - a way of testing & reverse engineering
   the bit addressing in the 320x200 (but actually 40x25 byte) screen of the
   C64
3. [`cbm_to_float.py`](./src/cbm_to_float.py) - a script of converting C64
   floating point numbers (5 byte) to python floats for easy debugging with
   the VICE monitor
